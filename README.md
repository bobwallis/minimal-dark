============
Minimal, dark, Arch Linux themes for rEFInd and Plymouth.

rEFInd
-------------------------
Loosely based on EvanPurkhiser's [rEFInd-minimal-theme](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal-theme), but with white logos on a black background.

Plymouth
-------------------------
Made by modifying the [Arch Logo](http://karlinux.deviantart.com/art/Arch-Logo-Plymouth-Theme-209553250) theme, which in turn is based on debian-logo.
