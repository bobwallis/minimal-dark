minimal-dark
============
Minimal, dark, Arch Linux themes for rEFInd and Plymouth.

rEFInd
-------------------------
Loosely based on EvanPurkhiser's [rEFInd-minimal-theme](https://github.com/EvanPurkhiser/rEFInd-minimal-theme), but with white logos on a black background.

To use, copy the refind folder nto `minimal-dark` into your rEFInd EFI folder (usually `/boot/EFI/refind/`), then add the line `include minimal-dark/theme.conf` to the end of your `refind.conf`.

You might want to add some more icons into the `icons` folder if you use different OSs to me.

Plymouth
-------------------------
Made by modifying the [Arch Logo](http://karlinux.deviantart.com/art/Arch-Logo-Plymouth-Theme-209553250) theme, which in turn is based on debian-logo.
