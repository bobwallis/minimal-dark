## Minimal Dark rEFInd theme

To use this theme clone it into `minimal-dark` in  your rEFInd EFI folder 
(usually `/boot/EFI/refind/`), then add the line `include minimal-dark/theme.conf`
to the end of your `refind.conf`.

You might want to add some more icons into the `icons` folder if you use
different OSs to me.
